## Why this bot
I don't know I was very bored

# Setup

## What you will need
- [ ] A bot account on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- [ ] A MySql server

## Setting up the database
In this repo's `docs` folder you will find the `createDb.sql` file. 
Execute the contents of this file onto your database server. 

## Setting up the bot
When you run the bot for the first time a config.json file will be created. In this file you need to enter your database credentials and your Bot Token.
You can restart the bot after you've saved the file and the bot should be ready to go.
